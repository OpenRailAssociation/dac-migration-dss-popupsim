"""Unit tests for the PopupSim simulation entry point.

This module contains unit tests that exercise the PopupSim faÃ§ade used by the
backend simulation. Tests verify that PopupSim delegates simulation control to
the provided adapter objects and that integration-style examples show how to
construct a full simulation using ScenarioBuilder and SimPyAdapter.

The tests are written for pytest and use lightweight fake adapters to avoid
depending on an actual simpy environment in unit test runs.

Notes
-----
- Test classes are marked with ``@pytest.mark.unit`` to allow selective runs.
- Some tests include illustrative code guarded by ``if __name__ == '__main__'``
  and are not executed during normal pytest discovery.

Examples
--------
Run only popup-sim related tests:

>>> uv run pytest popupsim/backend/tests/unit/test_sim_popupsim.py
