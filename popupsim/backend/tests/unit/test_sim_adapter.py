"""Unit tests for the SimPyAdapter implementation.

This module contains pytest unit tests for the SimPyAdapter faÃ§ade used by the
backend simulation. Tests verify that the adapter delegates to a simpy-like
environment (current time, timeout, run, and process scheduling). Tests use
the real `simpy` package and therefore do not inject fake modules into
sys.modules.
