"""Simulate popupsim scenarios.

This module keeps the simulation framework isolated from the domain logic.
It provides adapters to different simulation backends (e.g., SimPy).
It also provides builders for constructing simulation scenarios in a fluent manner.
It provides a small concurrency mode : a pool of workers executing tasks in parallel.
in a workshop which has multiple retrofit stations going on concurrently.

All waiting and scheduling is expressed via the adapter interface, so the domain logic
remains agnostic of the underlying simulation framework.
