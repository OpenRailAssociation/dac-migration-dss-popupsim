# User Stories - PopUpSim

The user stories listed here are based on [1].

## Strategic Phase

### <a id="us-001"></a>US-001: Develop Standardized Pop-Up Workshops
**As a** Strategic Migration Planner
**I want to** develop standardized designs for Pop-Up workshops,
**so that** I can provide them to the project.

### <a id="us-002"></a>US-002: Estimate Throughput for Workshop Layouts
**As a** Strategic Migration Planner
**I want to** estimate what throughput of wagons is possible in a Pop-Up workshop with a specific layout,
**so that** I can see how many workshops are needed.

## Detail Planning Phase

### <a id="us-003"></a>US-003: Import Infrastructure Data
**As a** Company Planner
**I want to** easily import infrastructure data and conveniently assign functions to tracks,
**so that** I can continue working quickly.

### <a id="us-004"></a>US-004: Assess Capacity for Planned Workshop
**As a** Company Planner
**I want to** get an estimate of how many wagons my planned workshop can retrofit,
**so that** I can see if the capacity is sufficient or needs to be increased.

### US-005: Clear Results Presentation
**As a** Company Planner
**I want to** get the output presented clearly in graphical and tabular form,
**so that** I can quickly understand the results.

### US-006: European Planning Validation
**As a** Deployment Manager
**I want to** see if the plans of individual companies fit together,
**so that** I can determine if the strategic goal is achievable at the European level.

## Implementation Phase

### US-007: Support Dispatch Decisions
**As a** Dispatcher
**I want to** know which wagons should be fed to the workshop next,
**so that** I can make dispatch decisions.

### US-008: Progress Monitoring
**As a** Deployment Manager
**I want to** monitor progress,
**so that** I can initiate countermeasures if necessary.

## Domain Context

### Big Bang Scenario
The user stories refer to the rapid retrofit of approximately 500,000 freight wagons from screw coupling to Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC) in a short period (approximately 3 weeks).

### Pop-Up Workshops
Temporarily established workshops where pre-equipped wagons are finally retrofitted from screw coupling to DAC in large numbers.

### Simulation Scope
- **Microscopic simulation** of individual wagons and resources
- **Focus on workshop operations**, not on general railway operations simulation
